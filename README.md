# Bikesharing

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a data-driven proposal to an angel investor on how the bikesharing business may work in Des Moines, Iowa. The angel inverstor might be intersted in providing seed funding to explore a bike sharing program, but needs a detailed analysis to make their decision. The project delivers data analysis of the bikesharing business based on a dataset from the Citi Bike program run in New York City. 

### Approach

For this analysis, Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, a set of visualizations in Tableau was created to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
- Create a final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

### Deliverables: 

1. Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
2. Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
3. Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
